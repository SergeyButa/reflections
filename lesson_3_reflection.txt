When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would want to use remote repository to work with project remotedly, from different places with internet connection.
    Or I would want remote repository when working on projects in collaboration with another programmers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If I work on project in collaboration with other people, I want to be sure, that my local version of project is the last, and it has all changes from another people. It may also help to reduce possible conflicts.
