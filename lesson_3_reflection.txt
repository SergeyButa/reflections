When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would want to use remote repository to work with project remotedly, from different places with internet connection.
    Or I would want remote repository when working on projects in collaboration with another programmers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If I work on project in collaboration with other people, I want to be sure, that my local version of project is the last, and it has all changes from another people. It may also help to reduce possible conflicts.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    I would use forks to work on projects from another authors (to experiment with the code, adding some features, etc.). I would use clones to work on my projects in collaboration with another programmers, or when I need to work on project from different places/several computers. I would use branches to experiment with my code or add  new features to it.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It helps reduce possible collaboration conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without Git or GitHUB I would use email and Skype or another messangers to discuss changes in code. It would be easier to discuss projects, but it would be harder to see what changes had been made, it would be took more time to explain what I have been changed in code.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
